Borderlands 3 Critique: No Guns, No Glory

INTRO: 

Borderlands has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a while now.  Think of it as
the Taco Bell of FPS games. You know it's not good for you, but when it's 2 a.m
and you've got the munchies, it hits the spot. So how does the latest entry in
this decade-old franchise hold up? Especially considering that other looter
shooters have become tremendously popular in recent years?


STORY:

I normally try to focus on breaking down a game's mechanics and combat, since I
think that's where core player experience lies. Thus, story is mostly
superfluous for me, especially considering that most titles have awful
narratives. However, there are game that go beyond that and are hellbent at
shoving in as much of their awful writing as possible. Borderlands 3 is a prime
example of this. Most of the characters are simultaneously annoying and
one-dimensional, which are especially problematic considering they never shut
up. The game is obsessed with its dank memes and other shitty jokes and
relentless bombards you with them through the in-game radio. I suspect this is
a ploy to cover up its trashfire of a story, which hinges upon major characters
acting like complete idiots and dying because they conviently forgot that they
had god powers. This is all exacerbated because the game has multiple classes
and a NG+ option for scaled loot. So if you want to max out all four vault
hunters, you could be potentially playing the campaign eight times over. 

Why there is no adventure mode option to skip through the story and dialogue on
subsequent playthroughs, I don't know, but the lack of one kills any desire I
have to try out another class. So, with that rant out of the way, let's examine
the gameplay of Borderlands 3, which thankfully fares much better.


Let's address the elephant in the room: the bugs. For a game that's over six
months old, Borderlands 3 is shockingly unstable. A small subset of the issues
I've had are: losing hours of saved progress, frequent crashes to desktop,
performance hitching, and unreliable multiplayer.

Overall, I've got mixed feeling on Borderlands 3. On one hand, it's nice to see
drastic improvements to combat alongside many needed QOL tweaks. It's the first
time I can say that I've genuinely enjoyed the gunplay. On the other hand, the
series still masturbates to its awful meme-ridden humor, to the detriment of
the pacing. Borderlands does not need dank memes to be enjoyable, as the
gameplay stands on its own, but Gearbox still feels obliged to include them.
